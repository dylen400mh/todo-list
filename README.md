# Todo List App

This project is a Todo List app implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective is to demonstrate skills in creating dynamic todo-items, organizing code using modules, handling user interactions, and adding persistence using the Web Storage API.

## Project Overview
The Todo List app allows users to create, edit, and delete todo-items. Each todo-item has a title, description, due date, and priority level. Users can view all their todos organized by projects or separate lists. The app provides default projects, and users can create new projects to categorize their todos. The UI displays todo-items with different colors based on their priority, and users can expand a todo to view and edit its details. Additionally, the app persists data using the Web Storage API, so todos will be retained even after refreshing the page.

## Skills Demonstrated
Creating dynamic todo-items with properties such as title, description, due date, and priority, using JavaScript.
Organizing code using separate modules for application logic and DOM manipulation.
Handling user interactions to create, edit, and delete todo-items, and switch between projects.
Storing and retrieving data using the Web Storage API (localStorage).
Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly UI for a Todo List app.
